### Research Internship Experience

**Neurophysiology Lab, Seoul National University, Winter 2020**  
**Supervisor: Professor Sang-Jung Kim**

During my undergraduate internship at Professor Sang-Jung Kim's Neurophysiology Lab at Seoul National University, I engaged in advanced neurophysiological research using the UCLA Miniscope for single-photon imaging. This experience provided me with hands-on expertise in cutting-edge imaging technology and its application in neuroscience research.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Single-Photon Imaging:** Utilized the UCLA Miniscope to conduct single-photon imaging, allowing for high-resolution observation of neuronal activity in live animal models.
- **Visual Stimulus Analysis:** Investigated how neuronal activity changes in response to various visual stimuli, contributing to a better understanding of visual processing in the brain.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Collected and analyzed large datasets of neuronal activity, employing statistical methods to interpret the results and draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Collaborative Research:** Worked closely with graduate students and researchers, contributing to ongoing projects and participating in lab meetings to discuss findings and refine experimental approaches.

**Skills Gained:**

- **Technical Proficiency:** Gained practical experience in handling and operating advanced imaging equipment and software.
- **Data Analysis:** Enhanced my ability to analyze complex biological data and present findings clearly and concisely.
- **Scientific Communication:** Improved my skills in scientific writing and presentation through regular updates and discussions of my research progress.

This internship not only deepened my understanding of neurophysiology but also solidified my interest in pursuing further research in neuroscience. The experience of observing real-time neuronal activity in response to stimuli was both fascinating and enlightening, reinforcing my commitment to contributing to this dynamic field.
