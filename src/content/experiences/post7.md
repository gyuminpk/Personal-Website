### Research Experience

**Seoul National University, Department of Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Neural Computation Lab, Research Assistant**  
**Apr 2024 - Present**

As a Research Assistant in the Neural Computation Lab at Seoul National University, I conduct advanced research on mice neurons using cutting-edge imaging and computational techniques.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Calcium Ion Imaging:** Conducted research on A1 neurons of mice by performing calcium ion imaging using the Inscopix-nVoke system.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed imaging data using Python to extract meaningful insights from neural activity patterns.
- **Computational Modeling:** Developed computational models of the brain to predict neural pattern reactions using NEURON, NetPyne, and Python.
- **Machine Learning:** Applied machine learning techniques to decode neural signals and enhance the understanding of neural computation.
- **Single-Photon Neuron Imaging:** Utilized single-photon neuron imaging techniques to observe and analyze neural activity in real-time.

**Skills Gained:**

- **Advanced Imaging:** Gained proficiency in using the Inscopix-nVoke system for calcium ion imaging and single-photon neuron imaging.
- **Python Programming:** Enhanced skills in Python for data analysis and computational modeling.
- **Computational Neuroscience:** Developed expertise in computational neuroscience tools such as NEURON and NetPyne.
- **Machine Learning:** Acquired experience in applying machine learning algorithms to decode neural activity.
- **Neural Data Analysis:** Improved ability to analyze complex neural data and draw meaningful conclusions from experimental results.

This experience has provided me with a strong foundation in both experimental and computational neuroscience, equipping me with the skills necessary to contribute to advanced research in brain and cognitive sciences.
