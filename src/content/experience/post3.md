### Consulting Startup Experience

**Research Assistant at YishanLinks, Mar 2020 - Jul 2020** 


During my time at a consulting startup, I worked on a project with Korea Post where I visualized postmanâ€™s workload by location and route difficulty through the analysis of actual delivery big data using Microsoft Access (DBMS) and Tableau. This project allowed me to suggest better ways to distribute the delivery quota. Through this experience, I learned various approaches to persuade others and handle data effectively.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed large datasets of delivery information using Microsoft Access to identify patterns and insights.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations using Tableau to represent postman workloads by location and route difficulty, making complex data easily understandable.
- **Optimization:** Suggested optimized methods for distributing delivery quotas based on data-driven insights, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce workload imbalances.
- **Collaboration:** Worked closely with Korea Post representatives to understand their needs and incorporate their feedback into the analysis and recommendations.

**Skills Gained:**

- **Technical Proficiency:** Enhanced skills in using Microsoft Access for data management and Tableau for data visualization.
- **Data Interpretation:** Improved ability to interpret complex datasets and derive actionable insights.
- **Problem-Solving:** Developed solutions for optimizing delivery routes and workloads, demonstrating critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- **Communication:** Learned effective methods for presenting data-driven recommendations and persuading stakeholders.
- **Collaboration:** Gained experience in working collaboratively with a large organization, understanding their operational challenges and requirements.
- **Persuasion:** Mastered techniques to convince and influence clients and stakeholders.
- **Analytical Thinking:** Strengthened ability to analyze data and present findings in a compelling manner.
