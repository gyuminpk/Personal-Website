### Research Experience

**Anatomy Lab, Korea University, 2014 - 2015**  
**Supervisor: Professor Im-Joo Yoo**

During my high school graduation research at Professor Im-Joo Yoo's Anatomy Lab at Korea University, I conducted research to observe neuronal plasticity changes in rats under reinforced learning environments. This project involved the use of various advanced techniques such as Golgi staining and the camera lucida method.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Neuronal Plasticity Research:** Investigated changes in neuronal plasticity in rats subjected to reinforced learning environments, aiming to understand how different stimuli impact brain function.
- **Golgi Staining:** Utilized Golgi staining techniques to visualize and analyze the morphology of neurons, allowing for detailed observation of dendritic structures.
- **Camera Lucida Method:** Applied the camera lucida method to create detailed drawings of neuronal structures, facilitating precise measurement and analysis.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Gathered and analyzed data on neuronal morphology, employing statistical methods to interpret findings and draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Collaborative Research:** Collaborated with fellow researchers and lab members, participating in discussions and contributing to the lab's overall research objectives.

**Skills Gained:**

- **Technical Experience:** Developed practical skills in advanced staining and imaging techniques, including Golgi staining and the camera lucida method.
- **Scientific Communication:** Improved scientific writing and presentation skills through regular updates and discussions of research progress.
- **Experimental Design:** Gained experience in designing and conducting experiments to investigate specific research questions.

This research experience not only provided me with valuable technical skills but also deepened my understanding of neuroplasticity and the impact of environmental factors on brain function. The hands-on experience in advanced research techniques reinforced my passion for neuroscience and my commitment to pursuing a career in this field.
