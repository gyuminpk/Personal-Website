### Research Experience

**Seoul National University, Department of Biosystem Engineering, Bachelor's Thesis**  
**2022**

For my bachelor's thesis at Seoul National University, I conducted research on the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM) on the viability and osteogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells under the guidance of the Department of Biosystem Engineering.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Photobiomodulation Research:** Investigated the effects of PBM using a specific light (950 nm, 300Hz, duty cycle: 30%) on dental pulp stem cells treated with Antimycin A to intentionally inhibit cellular respiration.
- **Cell Viability Assay:** Measured cell viability using the WST-1 assay at different time points (0 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours) after PBM treatment.
- **Osteogenic Differentiation Assay:** Assessed osteogenic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells using the ALP activity assay after PBM treatment at daily intervals for 4, 6, and 8 days.
- **Data Analysis:** Analyzed experimental data to determine the positive effects of 950 nm PW-PBM on cell viability and osteogenic differentiation recovery under conditions of inhibited cellular respiration.

**Skills Gained:**

- **Experimental Techniques:** Gained proficiency in using PBM and performing assays such as WST-1 and ALP activity assays.
- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Developed strong skills in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting biological data to draw meaningful conclusions.
- **Research Methodology:** Enhanced understanding of experimental design and methodology in the context of biomedical engineering research.
- **Scientific Communication:** Improved ability to document research findings and present results in a clear and concise manner.

This research experience provided me with valuable insights into the application of photobiomodulation in biomedical research and its potential therapeutic benefits. The skills and knowledge acquired during this project have equipped me to contribute effectively to the field of biosystem engineering.
